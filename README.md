# Hedgr

Synthetix stakers have the difficult job of hedging their exposure to the global debt pool. Recently, certain liquidity incentives in the Synthetix ecosystem have encouraged some participants to take a position in iETH (short ETH) even though they're bullish on ETH. This is one example of many where stakers may want to pursue complex hedging strategies from the convenience of their staking wallet.

Hedgr is a smart contract wallet designed for sophisticated staking and hedging. The first strategy available is a leveraged ETH position using Aave's Lending Pool as source of leverage and liquidity.
